# User Guide
## Endpoint

Endpoint is an HTTP/HTTPS endpoint that receives HTTP/HTTPS requests from the Internet and proxies them to your app.
Endpoint consists of ALB (Application Load Balancer), ACM (Amazon Certificate Manager) certificate, and Route53 record.

### Create a new endpoint

```
$ bcn endpoint create --district=<district name> --certificate-arn=<ACM certificate ARN> --public
```

#### Options

- `--district`: District name where you want to create a new endpoint
- `--certificate-arn` ACM Certificate ARN
  - If you specify this option, Barcelona automatically configures the endpoint so that it accepts HTTPS requests.
  - Note that if you do not specify it, HTTPS will not be available on your endpoint.
- `--public`: If specified, Endpoint accepts requests from the Internet. If not, Endpoint is visible only from district's private network
